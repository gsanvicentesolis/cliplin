# Cliplin Tools Configuration
# 
# This file maps tool names to their corresponding HTML/SPA files.
# Tools are part of the Cliplin package and are located in the cliplin/tools/ directory.
#
# Tools can be referenced by relative paths (from tools/ directory) or absolute paths.
#
# Example:
#   tools:
#     ui-intent: ui-intent.html
#     another-tool: subdirectory/tool.html
#     custom-tool: /absolute/path/to/tool.html

tools:
  # Add Cliplin tools here:
  ui-intent: ui-intent/index.html
